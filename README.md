# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to better understand how to make web applications, along with how to use the applications needed for the course. I made this webpage for myself and others to better understand basic web development. I learned a lot about how to use GitHub, my Terminal, VSCode, along with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS.
